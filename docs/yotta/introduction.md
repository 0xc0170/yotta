# Introduction to yotta
Yotta is a tool that we're building at [mbed](https://mbed.org) to help ourselves and others build better software for C-family languages (that's C, C++ and Objective-C). It's a command line tool `yotta`, but also a culture of building software components that do one thing well, declare a clear interface, and can be re-used.

Get started by [installing yotta](/../yotta/installing.html), and following [the tutorial](/../tutorial/tutorial.html). Yotta is still early in development, so if you have questions/feedback or issues, please report them on our github [issue tracker](https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta/issues).
